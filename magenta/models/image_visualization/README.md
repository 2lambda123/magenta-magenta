# Image Visualization

Visualization is the task of producing an image that generalizes all images of its type (class). For example, a visualization of a cat would be an image generated by a neural network that was trained on a database with cat images that has four legs, paws, and other elements of cats. Because visualizations are generated from the learned parameters of neural networks, they are good representations of how the network percieves a certain class. Important work on image visualization is communicated in the following papers:  
[Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034). *Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman*.  
[Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization](http://www.evolvingai.org/files/2015_Yosinski_ICML.pdf). *Jason Yosinski et al.*.  

Google's DeepDream is a variation on image visualization where a normal image is passed through a neural network and is modified such that all activations are boosted at any layer. This creates a continuous loop that will continue to develop the classes visualized in the image over time. [DeepDream GitHub](https://github.com/google/deepdream)  

Visualization can be taken a step further by using it as a tool to generate art. For this, new techniques for eliminating noise, scaling up the image, and other image processing have been developed over the past few years. The code in this demo comes from the deepdream code by Google, the [code](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/deepdream/blob/master/dream.ipynb) from Kyle McDonald, [code](https://github.com/auduno/deepdraw) from Auduno for using GoogleNet, and the use of bilateral filtering from Mike Tyka.  

The demo uses the GoogleNet and is trained on the imagenet database. There is a text file in this directory that translates the imagenet class ids to the class names.  

# Setup
Whether you want to stylize an image with one of our pre-trained models or train your own model, you need to set up your [Magenta environment](/README.md).
