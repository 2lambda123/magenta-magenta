## A.I. Jam

An interactive A.I. jam session.

## ABOUT

This interface uses the frontend from the [A.I. Duet experiment](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-ai-duet), combined with the [Magenta MIDI interface](/magenta/interfaces/midi/README.md) to recreate the experience of the award-winning [Magenta 2016 NIPS Demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/12/16/nips-demo) in your browser.

This is not an official Google product.

## CREDITS

Original interface built by [Yotam Mann](https://github.com/tambien) with friends on the Magenta and Creative Lab teams at Google using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and open-source tools from the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) project.

## GETTING STARTED

Install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Magenta](/README.md#Installation). Also download the following pre-trained models, and save them to this directory.

* [Attention RNN](http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/models/attention_rnn.mag)
* [Pianoroll RNN-NADE](http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/models/pianoroll_rnn_nade.mag)
* [Drum Kit RNN](http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/models/drum_kit_rnn.mag)

Then launch the experience from the command line:

```bash
sh RUN_DEMO.sh
```

## BUILDING

If you'd like to make modifications to this code, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6 or above installed. And then install of the dependencies of the project and build the code by typing the following in the terminal:

```bash
cd static
npm install
node_modules/.bin/webpack -w
```

## MIDI SUPPORT

The A.I. Duet supports MIDI keyboard input using [Web Midi API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) and the [WebMIDI](https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi) library.

## PIANO KEYBOARD

The piano can also be controlled from your computer keyboard thanks to [Audiokeys](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys). The center row of the keyboard is the white keys.
